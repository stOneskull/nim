#   raylib [vectors] lesson 5 - The Transformation Trinity
#
#   This lesson demonstrates:
#   - The three fundamental transformations: Scale, Rotate, Translate.
#   - The matrix representation for each transformation.
#   - The difference between an object's description (Model Space) and the
#     underlying scene (World Space).
#   - How multiple objects can be transformed independently in the same space.

  # LESSON 1: OBJECT DESCRIPTION (MODEL SPACE)
  # An object is just a list of vertices (points) that describe its shape.
  # These are defined in "Model Space", meaning they are relative to the object's
  # own center (0,0), not the world.
  let triangleVertices = [
    Vector2(x:  0.0, y: -30.0),
    Vector2(x: -30.0, y:  30.0),
    Vector2(x:  30.0, y:  30.0)

  # LESSON 2: THE UNDERLYING SPACE (WORLD SPACE)
  # We can place multiple objects in our world. Each needs its own position.
  let triangleBasePos = Vector2(x: screenWidth * 0.25, y: screenHeight / 2.0)
  let quadWorldPos = Vector2(x: screenWidth * 0.75, y: screenHeight / 2.0)

    # Update

    time += getFrameTime() # Accumulate time for smooth animation

    # LESSON 3: THE TRANSFORMATION MATRICES
    # We will create a unique transformation matrix for each object.

    # --- Triangle: Rotation and Translation ---
    let triRotation = time * 50.0 # Degrees

    # Create a diagonal movement from the base position towards the bottom-left.
    # sin(time) oscillates between -1 and 1. We'll map this to a 0-to-1 range.
    let movementFactor = (sin(time) + 1.0) / 2.0 # Ranges from 0.0 to 1.0
    let startPos = triangleBasePos
    let endPos = Vector2(x: 100.0, y: screenHeight - 100.0)
    let triangleWorldPos = lerp(startPos, endPos, movementFactor)

    # 1. The Rotation Matrix: Rotates the object around its own origin.
    # For 2D, this is a rotation around the Z-axis.
    let rotationMatrix: Matrix = rotateZ(triRotation * DEG2RAD)

    # --- Quad: Scaling and Translation ---
    # Create a "pulsing" scale effect using the sine function.
    let scaleFactor = 1.0 + sin(time * 2.0) * 0.4

    # 3. The Scaling Matrix: Stretches or shrinks the object from its origin.
    # It looks like this, with scale factors on the diagonal:
    # | sx  0   0   0 |
    # | 0   sy  0   0 |
    # | 0   0   sz  0 |
    # | 0   0   0   1 |
    let scalingMatrix: Matrix = scale(scaleFactor, scaleFactor, 1.0)

    # It needs its own translation matrix to move it to its world position.
    let quadTranslationMatrix: Matrix = translate(quadWorldPos.x, quadWorldPos.y, 0.0)

    # Combine them. To achieve the effect of "Scale, then Translate", we must multiply
    # the matrices in the reverse order: M_model = M_translate * M_scale.
    let quadModelMatrix: Matrix = multiply(quadTranslationMatrix, scalingMatrix)
    
    # LESSON 4: TRANSFORMING THE VERTICES (CPU-side)
    # NOTE: For Vector2, we must separate rotation and translation for predictable results.
    # 1. Rotate the vertex in its local space.
    # 2. Translate the rotated vertex to its world space position by adding the position vector.
    let transformedTriV1 = transform(triangleVertices[0], rotationMatrix) + triangleWorldPos
    let transformedTriV2 = transform(triangleVertices[1], rotationMatrix) + triangleWorldPos
    let transformedTriV3 = transform(triangleVertices[2], rotationMatrix) + triangleWorldPos

    # For clarity and scalability, let's put the transformed quad vertices into an array.
#[  let transformedQuadV1 = transform(quadVertices[0], quadModelMatrix)
    let transformedQuadV2 = transform(quadVertices[1], quadModelMatrix)
    let transformedQuadV3 = transform(quadVertices[2], quadModelMatrix)
    let transformedQuadV4 = transform(quadVertices[3], quadModelMatrix) ]#

#[ Think of it like a "connect-the-dots" puzzle.

Your original shape (quadVertices) is the set of numbered dots on the page in their starting positions.
The transformation matrix (quadModelMatrix) is a set of instructions that tells you where to move each individual dot.
The drawing functions (drawLine in your case) are you, with a pencil, drawing straight lines between the new positions of the dots.
The matrix itself has no concept of a "line"; it only knows how to take an input point (x, y) and output a new point (x', y'). ]#
